# Cryptocurrencies_Analysis

## Utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenge Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to provide a report for potential clients who are considering investing in the bitcoin market. The client, a well-known investment bank, wants to offer its customers a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. To provide our customer a better understanding of the crypto world, we need to generate a report that covers all of the existing cryptocurrencies on the trading market, as well as how these currencies can be grouped together to build a classification system for the new investment portfolio.

To perform this study, we must first preprocess the desired dataset so that it can be fitted into a clustering method (K-means). Data visualizations can be created to present our findings after our unsupervised machine learning models have been run.

# Results

Only 1,144 cryptocurrencies were currently trading in the initial dataset, which included 1,252 items. Null values were removed from the data, leaving only cryptocurrencies with a total number of produced coins greater than 0. In the end, 532 marketable cryptocurrencies were discovered.
